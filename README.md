# skos-cloud
A word cloud aesthetic for visualizing SKOS vocabularies

This visualization provides clean and simple at-a-glance view of a SKOS vocabulary, with additional relationships highlighted on hover. It is written specifically for [Django-SKOSxl](https://github.com/rob-metalinkage/django-skosxl) and to a lesser extent [the Odysseus Web Browser](https://github.com/alcinnz/Odysseus/). 

In Odysseus this will ensure "installing" vocabularies straight from their source does not look too technical.

P.S. Using in combination with https://github.com/sammdot/roadgeek-fonts would be appropriate for django-skosxl/django-gazateer.
